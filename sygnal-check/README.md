# sygnal-check

A static checker for [Sygnal](https://sygnal.js.org) apps. It finds the string-wiring bugs that fail silently at runtime: an intent selector that matches nothing, an intent action with no model entry, an EVENTS type nobody listens to, and similar.

```bash
npx sygnal-check                 # checks ./src
npx sygnal-check src/components  # files, directories or globs
npx sygnal-check "src/**/*.tsx" --json
```

It parses JS, JSX, TS and TSX with `@babel/parser`. It never runs your code and doesn't depend on `sygnal`.

## Output

```
src/App.jsx:20:15 SYG110 App: selector '.add-todo-button' targets .add-todo-button, but App's view never renders that class, so this action never fires (did you mean '.add-todo-btn'? The view renders className="add-todo-btn")
src/App.jsx:24:21 SYG104 App: selector '.remove' targets .remove, which is only rendered inside child component <TodoItem>; parents can't see DOM events inside child components (handle it in <TodoItem> and send it up via PARENT or EVENTS)

sygnal-check: 2 warnings
```

Each line has the form `file:line:col CODE [severity] Component: message (fix)`. The severity tag only appears for non-warnings. Info-level findings are hidden unless you pass `--verbose`.

## Options

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Print an array of diagnostics (see below) |
| `--fail-on=warn\|error\|never` | Exit with code 1 when a diagnostic at this level or above exists. The default is `warn`. Info never fails the run |
| `--verbose` | Also print info-level findings |
| `--include-tests` | Also scan `*.test.*` / `*.spec.*` files (skipped by default) |
| `--strict` | Canonical-form rules (SYG5xx). **Not implemented yet** |
| `--graph` | Print the app graph. **Not implemented yet** |

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` findings at or above `--fail-on`, `2` usage error (bad option, no files, `--strict`/`--graph`).

## Rules

The codes are the same as Sygnal's runtime diagnostics (`https://sygnal.js.org/reference/errors#sygNNN`).

| Code | Severity | Finds |
|---|---|---|
| SYG110 | warn | An intent selector (`DOM.select('.x')`, `DOM.click('.x')` or any other shorthand) whose class or id the component's own view never renders. The view is read from static `className`/`class`/`id` strings, `classes()`/`clsx()` calls, template literals, `+` concatenation, conditionals, `[..].join(' ')`, local and module-level consts, module-level render helpers, `h()` and hyperscript helpers, and the `className` of `<Collection>`/`<Switchable>`. The fix suggests the closest class the view does render. The finding is downgraded to **info** when a dynamic className (e.g. `` `tab-${kind}` `` or `props.className`) might produce the class, or when the selector itself isn't a static string. |
| SYG104 | warn | The class or id is rendered, but only inside a **child** component, i.e. in the child's JSX, in JSX passed into it as children or slots, or in a `<Collection of={X}>`/`<Switchable of={{…}}>` child, resolved through imports. Child components are isolated, so the parent never sees those events. |
| SYG101 | warn | An intent action with no model entry. `'ACTION \| SINK'` shorthand keys are expanded first. |
| SYG102 | warn | A model entry nothing can trigger: no intent action, not a built-in (`BOOTSTRAP`, `INITIALIZE`, `HYDRATE`, `DISPOSE`, `READY`), and never the target of a `next('X')` string literal. This is downgraded to info when the model calls `next()` with a non-literal name. |
| SYG105 | warn | An EVENTS type that is selected (`EVENTS.select('X')`) but never emitted, or emitted (`emit('X')`, `event('X')`, or `{ type: 'X' }` returned from an `EVENTS` sink) but never selected, anywhere in the scanned files. Only string literals are matched. This is downgraded to info when non-literal emits or selects exist. |
| SYG401 | warn | `<Collection from="x">` where `x` isn't a key of the component's `initialState` (or `calculated`), or its initial value is a literal that isn't an array. This is only checked when `initialState` is statically known. |
| SYG900 | warn | A file couldn't be parsed, or a rule crashed. |

### What counts as a component

A component is any function that gets an `.intent`, `.model`, `.initialState`, `.context` or `.calculated` assignment (or `Object.assign(X, {…})`). That covers function declarations, `const X = () => …`, `const X: Component<…> = function …`, `export default X`, and components declared inside other functions.

### Known limits

- Only the `DOM` source name is recognized (`DOMSourceName` overrides aren't).
- Selectors under `DOM.select('document' | 'body')` aren't checked, since they're page-wide by design.
- SYG105 only sees the files you scan. Check the whole app (`src`), not one folder of it.
- Classes added outside JSX (`innerHTML`, third-party widgets, `element.classList`) are invisible. An `innerHTML` prop or a `{...spread}` on an element makes the component's checks fall back to info.

## Suppressing a finding

Put a comment on the same line or on the line above:

```js
// sygnal-ignore SYG110
CLOSE: DOM.click('.injected-by-widget'),
OPEN: DOM.click('.other'), // sygnal-ignore
```

Without codes, the comment suppresses every code on that line.

## Programmatic API

```js
import { check } from 'sygnal-check'

const diagnostics = check(['src'], { cwd: process.cwd() })
// [{ code, severity, component, message, fix, docsUrl, text, data?, file, line, column }]
```

This is the runtime `Diagnostic` shape plus `file`, `line` and `column` (1-based), without `timestamp`.

`check(inputs, options)` takes:

- `inputs`: a path, directory or glob, or an array of them.
- `options.cwd`: the base for relative inputs and reported paths.
- `options.ignore`: codes to drop, e.g. `['SYG105']`.
- `options.includeTests`: also scan test and spec files.
- `options.strict`: also run strict rules (none yet).
- `options.rules`: a custom rule list.

For tooling, `buildProject(files)` returns the intermediate project model the rules query: components, intents, models, view classes and ids, child usages, collections, and events.

## Writing a rule

Each rule is a module in `src/rules/` that is registered in `src/rules/index.js`:

```js
export default {
  id: 'my-rule',
  codes: ['SYG1xx'],
  description: '…',
  run(project, report) {
    for (const comp of project.components) {
      report({ code: 'SYG1xx', component: comp.name, file: comp.file, node: comp.node, message: '…', fix: '…' })
    }
  },
}
```

Strict-mode rules go in `src/rules/strict/`. Every code must exist, with the same title, in Sygnal's runtime registry (`src/extra/diagnostics/codes.ts`). `test/codes.vtest.js` enforces this.

## Development

```bash
cd sygnal-check && npm install && npm test
```

Tests are named `*.vtest.js` so that the repo root's config-less `vitest run` doesn't pick them up.
